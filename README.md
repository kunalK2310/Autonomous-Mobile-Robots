# Autonomous-Mobile-Robots

This code was used for the final competition of AMR 2023 at Cornell University. The competition involved a design challenge where the robot had to localize itself within an environment and navigate toward designated waypoints. There were two types of waypoints: normal waypoints and extra credit waypoints, which were more difficult to reach due to the possible presence of additional walls. These walls may or may not have been present, and the robot had to determine their existence to plan an optimal trajectory. No ground truth pose was provided; instead, the robot had to estimate its own state using depth sensor readings and odometry data.
