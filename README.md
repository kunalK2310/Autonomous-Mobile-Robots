# Autonomous-Mobile-Robots
This is the code used for the final competition for AMR 2023 @ Cornell University. 
The final competition consisted of a design challenge to localize in an environment and navigate towards waypoints. There were two types of waypoints- normal waypoints and extra credit waypoints which were difficult to reach due to the added difficulty of additional walls were can or cannot be present and had to be determined by the robot for optimal trajectory.
No truth pose was provided and the robot had to estimate its state based on depth sensor readings and odometry data.
